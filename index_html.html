    <p>Golf plays on a different axis in the “Land of the Midnight Sun,” 
        and nowhere is that difference more pronounced than at Tromsø golf club,
         the world’s northernmost 18-hole golf course.</p>

    <p>Roughly 217 miles (350 kilometers) north of the Arctic Circle, Tromsø offers its
         70,000-plus population a slim golf season,
         as the city is blanketed in white during winter months. This year, the city’s course closed in March,
         when snow was up to 4.6 feet (140cm) deep, and didn’t open until June 17,
          before closing again on October 5.</p>

    <p>It’s an annual mad dash for the club’s two part-time greenkeepers, 
        challenged with clearing fairways of snow and ice before reseeding 
        the entire course. Given the size of the task, general manager Bjorn Sonsteby’s job
         responsibilities have expanded well beyond the typical remit.</p>

    <p>“It’s a very special job,” Sonsteby told CNN. “I do a lot of things by myself because I’m the
         one employed but I have a good board and a lot of volunteers and members that help.</p>
